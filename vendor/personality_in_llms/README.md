This project contains all the code necessary to verify the results of the paper

## Getting Started / Installation

Most of the code needed to reproduce the results of the paper are shared here in
the form of Jupyter notebooks. The main notebooks and requirements for running
the paper's psychometric and statistical analyses are located in `analysis`.

Inference scripts and requirements for collecting psychometric test and
downstream task data from HuggingFace and OpenAI models are located in
`inference_scripts`.

The main custom dependency of this project is the PsyBORGS psychometric test
administration framework
(https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/psyborgs). This
repo comes with its own version of the PsyBORGS code, but if a more up-to-date
version is needed, it can be downloaded from the link above. PsyBORGS-related
package dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file in its root
directory. For any other dependencies, they are `pip install`ed in the notebooks
themselves.

## Populating Copyrighted Instrument Items

The BFI item text in the admin session JSONs is `[REDACTED]` because the items
are copyrighted. To run experiments, you need to obtain the BFI separately and
populate the admin sessions using the hydration script.

1. Obtain the Big Five Inventory (BFI) from Oliver P. John (see John, O. P.,
   Donahue, E. M., & Kentle, R. L., 1991).
2. Create a local items file at `data/bfi_items.json` mapping item IDs to their
   text. See `scripts/bfi2_items.json.example` for the expected format.
3. Run the hydration script to produce a usable admin session:

```bash
python scripts/hydrate_admin_session.py \
    --admin_session admin_sessions/prod_run_01_external_rating.json \
    --items data/bfi_items.json \
    --output admin_sessions/local/prod_run_01_hydrated.json
```

The `data/` and `admin_sessions/local/` directories are gitignored to prevent
copyrighted content from being committed.

Note: The IPIP-NEO-300 items are already included in the admin sessions (they
are public domain).

## Data

All the test admininistration sessions - which are input for most of the
experiments in the paper - are stored in the `admin_sessions/` directory. Some
of the data used for visualization is stored in the `figures_data/` directory.
All other data are linked in the main paper and can be found on Google's
open source GCP repository:
(https://storage.googleapis.com/personality_in_llms/index.html).
